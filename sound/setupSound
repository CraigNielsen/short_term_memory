copy the .soundrc file to the home directory to overright the alsa settings. 
Now pulse audio will be used to route sound.
\
try run this now, doesnt work look at list below:

/usr/bin/pacmd set-sink-port alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo analog-output-headphones



else see: 
http://www.6by9.net/configuring-pulseaudio-for-multiple-output-devices/

run pacmd list-cards
look for the analogue pci card
run pacmd list-sinks
observe the analogue sink

find out the name of the headphones port (can plug in headphones and run list-sinks and look for active port.

finally set the sink port as shown in the commmand above, but sub in the values for the pci devices.
this should work.
