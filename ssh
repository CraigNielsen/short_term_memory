sudo service ssh start

commands : start stop restart status
use: sudo service ssh status -l

to enable on startup, rename /etc/init/ssh.conf.disable to 
/etc/init/ssh.conf (I have renamed to disabled, it is enabled when installed)
(change password to more secure if set to startup automatically)
sudo passwd USERNAME
