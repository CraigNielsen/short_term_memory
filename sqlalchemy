for parent class user and child class posts
	want to find all latests posts for user where post meets some criteria

want to join the two tables, and use filter to find the latest posts inside a query..

in sql :
SELECT [whatever]
FROM posts AS p
    LEFT JOIN users AS u ON u.user_id = p.user_id
WHERE p.post_time = (SELECT MAX(post_time) FROM posts WHERE user_id = u.user_id)

and in sqlalchemy:
s.query(Posts).\
    outerjoin(Posts.user).\
    filter(Posts.post_time==\
        s.query(
            func.max(Posts.post_time)
        ).
        filter(Posts.user_id==User.user_id).
        correlate(User)
    )
