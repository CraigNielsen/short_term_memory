.
host is a device connected to a network ie: device with ip
hostnames are aliases for ip's
1 word hostname is sometimes called unqualified hostname eg: webprod
dns is to transfer hostnames to ip's, also does reverse
.
FQDN fully qualified hostname: eg: webprod.mycompany.com
TLD top level domain eg: .com, .net, .org
Domains: just to left of TLD
Sub-domain: further divided. more than 3 parts to FQDN eg: webprod.ny.us.mycompany.com (info on the location of the server)
.
display hostname by: #> hostname -f or #> uname -n
hostname should be in /etc/hostname (distro dependant)
.
to resove DNS: host or dig commands
.
/etc/hosts contains ip addr to hostname configs
^^ not available to rest of the network
/etc/nsswitch.conf controls the order for search domain names ie: files then dns or visa versa

DHCP: Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol
assigns IP address to hosts on a network
when a client wants an ip it send a broadcast message looking for a DHCP server
The server then provides an ip, netmask, gateway and DNS servers
The DHCP client (some host on network) configures using this info
Each IP is "leased" from the pool of IP addresses the DHCP server manages.
The lease expiration time is configured on the DHCP server
The client must renew the lease if it wants to keep the IP Address.
If no renewal, the IP becomes available to other DHCP clients
.
configuring a DHCP client (dependent on distro)
#> ip link (lists network devices)
files: /etc/newtwork/interfaces
  and add the dhcp line to the interface
  auto eth0
  iface eth0 inet dhcp

Assigning a static IP address in Ubuntu system
/etc/network/interfaces
on the iface line add the static keyword, and supply address, netmask and gateway
eg:
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet static
  address 10.109.155.174
  netmask 255.255.255.0
  gateway 10.109.155.1

can assign ip addresses to devices:
ip address add IP[/NETMASK] dev NETWORK_DEVICE
eg: ip address add 10.11.12.13 dev eth0
eg: ip address add 10.11.12.13/255.255.255.0 dev eth0
ip link set eth0 up

Bringing up and down can use ifup/ifdown (disto dependent)
examples:
  ifup eth0
  ifup enp5s2
  ifdown eth0
  ifdown enp5s2
