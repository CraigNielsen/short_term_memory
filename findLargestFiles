$ cd /path/to/some/where
$ du -hsx * | sort -rh | head -10

Where,

du command -h option : display sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K, 234M, 2G).
du command -s option : show only a total for each argument (summary).
du command -x option : skip directories on different file systems.
sort command -r option : reverse the result of comparisons.
sort command -h option : compare human readable numbers. This is GNU sort specific option only.
head command -10 OR -n 10 option : show the first 10 lines.


There is no simple command available to find out the largest files/directories on a Linux/UNIX/BSD filesystem. However, combination of following three commands (using pipes) you can easily find out list of largest files:

du command : Estimate file space usage.
sort command : Sort lines of text files or given input data.
head command : Output the first part of files i.e. to display first 10 largest file.
find command : Search file.
Type the following command at the shell prompt to find out top 10 largest file/directories:
# du -a /var | sort -n -r | head -n 10
